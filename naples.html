            The 18th-century Trevi Fountain was built at the ending point of the aqueduct that supplied ancient Rome with water from the surrounding countryside. The fountain is a true emblem of Rome and has been featured in numerous films. Be wary however, it is very crowded, especially at night. The best time to see this beautiful fountain is before breakfast when the crowds are thin. Tradition says that if you throw a coin over your left shoulder into the fountain, you’ll find your way back to Rome. (The thousands of euros thrown into the fountain each day are donated to charity).
