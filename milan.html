<p>Milan located in Northern Italy is a global capital of fashion and design. Home to the national stock exchange, it’s a financial hub also known for its high-end restaurants, fashion and culture. The Duomo di Milano cathedral and the Santa Maria delle Grazie convent, housing Leonardo da Vinci’s mural “The Last Supper,” testify to centuries of art and culture.
<p>Located centrally in the north, the city is only a few hours away from the beautiful Lake Como, Genoa Coastline or the stunning city of Venice. For this reason, this is a must visit destination.

            <strong>This is the first item's accordion body.</strong> It is shown by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
